			<h3>9/18/2013</h3>
			<p>The video we watched during class was a story in the form of a letter that showed how a nephew is still hurt years after his uncle killed himself. The uncle killed himself because he could not take the suffering his community put on him because of their unacceptance of his sexual orientation. Now, the nephew has found himself in a very similar situation his uncle was in: divorced with kids and gay; however, the nephew’s letter is to tell his uncle that situation isn’t so bad that he had no way out except to take his own life, and that their situation only improves from that feeling of rock bottom.</p>
			<p>In the video, the nephew reads aloud his letter. This is a very emotional scene for the nephew, especially because he has put years of thought and reflection into this letter. Possibly the most important part of this video is at the end, where thetrevorproject.org, the website of an organization for suicide prevention, is posted. The nephew hopes that he can prevent another tragedy like the one of his uncle’s death with this video, and he uses the phrase “it gets better” to try to show someone dealing with any issue that could make him think the only way out of his predicament is to take his own life that there is always a light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
			<p>This message is structured in a relatively informal way as the nephew tells his story, and I believe that I can incorporate some of this informality into my Lived Experiences project to make it less like an essay and more like a narrative.</p>

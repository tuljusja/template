			<h1>Cultural Analysis (continued)</h1>
			<h5>Anticipated Results</h5>
			<p>If the NCAA did not count the time spent at a college without a hockey program towards the student’s hockey eligibility, many issues would be resolved. Junior hockey players would be able to spend their time not only on developing their hockey skills, but also starting to work towards their educational goals so they would not be at any disadvantage for their choice of pursuing their dreams. The academic struggle associated with years off from school would be nonexistent, as would be any influence of not attending college after aging out of this level of hockey because players being allowed to pursue their educational and athletic goals at the same time would not likely quit school once hockey was over for them. Also with this change, the impact of current college admissions would not be as serious, except possibly to players that would still be considered freshmen. The proposed change to the college admissions process would overall help not only some junior hockey players but also many nontraditional students also in finishing their education.</p>
			<h5>Conclusion</h5>
			<p>The movie Miracle has been such an influential piece of popular culture for the hockey community because of how it shows so vividly what being a part of a hockey team is like and inspires hockey players with its motivational story line. This movie promotes the goal of reaching USA Hockey’s ultimate level, college hockey, and consequently the stepping stone required to achieve that goal: junior hockey. Most people are not familiar with junior hockey and the risks inherent with a player’s choice to play at this level because in most collegiate sports players advance directly from high school to college. Some of these risks are associated with the system colleges use for admitting students and the way the NCAA eligibility is measured. If there were slight changes to these two procedures, hockey player’s academic and athletic goals would be much less conflicting. Miracle’s storyline endorsed a mindset to the current generation of hockey players that through hard work and perseverance, even what might seem to be impossible can happen. Perhaps it is up to this generation of hockey players to use this mindset to pressure these systems to change for the prosperity of future generations of hockey players.</p>
